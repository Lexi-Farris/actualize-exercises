# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
# For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

digits=[3,6,9]
index =0

while index >= digits.length 
    digits[index] * 3
    index =index + 1
end

puts digits

# I looked over the materials for arrays an hour or so before starting this and was excited that I didn't need my references to get the answer
