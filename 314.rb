# QUESTION 1
# Ancay ouyay igurefay histay neoay utoay?
# Pig Latin is a very sophisticated language in which 
# each English word is converted as follows: 
# The first letter of each word is removed from the beginning and added to the end. 
# Then, the letters 'ay' are added to the very end of the word.
# For example: hello = ellohay, pingpong = ingpongpay, marmalade = armalademay, etc.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a single word 
# and prints out the Pig Latin version of that word.

=begin
1 Ask the user to enter a single word. âœ…
  >convert that word to an array using .split method âœ…
2 Remove the first letter from the word
    >Use a while loop.
    >While the length of the array is shorter than the index, remove the letter in the 0 index position
    > Add that letter in index 0 position to the end of the array 
3 Add 'ay' to the end of the word  
4. Use .join to change the array back into a string
