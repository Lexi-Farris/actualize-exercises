# QUESTION 1
# Start your program with the line of code below.
# The rest of your program should create and print out 
# an array that removes all duplicates from the original array. 
# That is, the second array should look like: [4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7]
# The one catch: Don't use the "uniq" method available to arrays! (That would do this for you.)
=begin
1. create an empty array to store the new values in
2. count the number of times each number appears in the array 
  > get the strings from the array through array[index]
  > create code that == nil so that numbers can be counted & catologued
  > if number is == nil, count of the number should be set to 1
  > if nil is NOT found,number should go up by 1

3.remove any numbers that appear more than once


=end
duplicates ={}
numbers = [4, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 7]
