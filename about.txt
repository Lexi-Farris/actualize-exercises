Hey! I'm Lexi and I currently work at the VA as a Scrum Tester. I've had a lot of 'odd jobs' in tech from Techinal Support to CX Trainer to Triage Specialist. I know *about* coding but I'd love to actually learn to code properly. I've tried many online courses but self taught coding just isn't for me. I'm really excited to learn to code and to see what I accomplish!
